Labels have been anonymized, and are not interpretable. It uses an underfloor air distribution system with fan-powered terminal reheat coils for perimeter zones. Four roof-top units with VAV are located on the roof. The lighting system primariliy uses fluorescent luminaires and zone-based lighting controllers that communicate with user interface devices and wireless gatetways over DALI networks. The gateways collect occupancy and light sensor data over an ISM-band wireless network.",
