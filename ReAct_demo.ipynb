    "# Knowledge Graph Question Answering for Building Knowledge Graphs using a ReAct Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements an agentic workflow based on the **ReAct (Reasoning and Acting)** framework to translate natural language questions into precise SPARQL queries. The core of this notebook is a multi-turn refinement process where two specialized agents collaborate to produce, critique, and improve a SPARQL query until it is deemed correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🤖 Methodology: The Two-Agent Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "The agentic workflow is orchestrated by the `SparqlRefinementAgent` class and consists of an iterative loop between two Large Language Model (LLM) powered agents:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Query Writer Agent**:\n",
    "    * **Role**: To generate and revise SPARQL queries.\n",
    "    * **Action**: Given a natural language question and a subset (defined by `num_triples` of the graph) of the graph, it writes an initial SPARQL query. In subsequent turns, it revises the query based on feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Critique Agent**:\n",
    "    * **Role**: To evaluate the query's correctness.\n",
    "    * **Action**: After the Writer's query is executed, the Critique agent reviews the original question, the query itself, and a summary of the execution results. It then makes a decision:\n",
    "        * `FINAL`: The query is correct and successfully answers the question. The loop terminates.\n",
    "        * `IMPROVE`: The query is incorrect, incomplete, or inefficient. The agent provides specific, actionable feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "This feedback is then passed back to the Query Writer Agent, which begins the next iteration by generating an improved query. This cycle continues until a `FINAL` decision is reached or the maximum number of iterations is exceeded.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚙️ Execution Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook follows a systematic process for each building and question:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Configuration**: Configure your API keys and URL for LLM calls.\n",
    "2.  **Initialize Agents**: The `SparqlRefinementAgent` is instantiated.\n",
    "3.  **Define a helper function for testing a single question**: `run_single_question` function is defined for initial testing.\n",
    "4.  **Configure the necessary test conditions**: Key parameters such as the target building (`BUILDING_NAME`), LLM (`MODEL_NAME`), and SPARQL endpoint are set.\n",
    "5.  **Process All Questions and Buildings**: The script iterates through each question in the JSON file.\n",
    "    * The **ReAct loop** is triggered for the current question.\n",
    "    * The final query generated by the agent is executed.\n",
    "    * The ground-truth query is executed for comparison.\n",
    "    * Key metrics are computed and saved. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📊 Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "To rigorously assess the correctness of the generated SPARQL query, the following metrics are calculated and logged:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Arity Matching F1**: Checks if the query returned the correct **number of columns**.\n",
    "* **Exact Match F1**: A strict check for identical row content and column **order**, though it ignores column names.\n",
    "* **Entity Set F1**: Flexibly checks if the correct **sets of values** were retrieved in each column, regardless of row structure or column order.\n",
    "* **Row Matching F1**: The most robust metric. It finds the optimal column alignment and then checks for an exact, row-for-row match of the content. This is the primary indicator of a perfectly correct query."

First, the error message (\"nodename nor servname provided\") indicates an environment or endpoint connectivity problem rather than a SPARQL syntax error. You should verify that the endpoint URI is correct and that you have network access. Second, the heuristics used to identify Brick points are limited. The question asks for Brick points, which in Brick Schema are typically sensors, commands, or setpoints. The current query only checks for URIs containing \"Command\" or \"Setpoint\" and types whose local name contains \"Command\", thereby neglecting sensor types that might also be points. It would be advisable to extend the heuristics (or use explicit Brick type checking if possible) to include sensors, or to base the query on a more robust understanding of how Brick point entities are modeled in your data. Therefore, while the query structure is on the right track, both connectivity issues and heuristic limitations need addressing.\n",

      "1. The error reported—“urlopen error [Errno 8] nodename nor servname provided, or not known”—suggests that the endpoint or service isn’t reachable, which might be due to a misconfiguration of the endpoint URL rather than an issue with the query syntax itself. Make sure you are pointing to a reachable SPARQL endpoint.\n",

      "2. The heuristic of using regex on the type URI/string is brittle. Brick Schema defines explicit classes (e.g., brick:Temperature_Sensor, brick:Command, brick:Setpoint, etc.), or even a common superclass like brick:Point, if available. It would be more reliable to explicitly query for instances of these classes. This is particularly true if new types are added or if naming doesn’t follow the assumed pattern.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Relying on the regex on the ?point URI (i.e., the resource identifier) might capture unintended matches. It would be better to solely or primarily focus on the ?pointType where the type is more controlled and semantically intended to be used to classify points.\n",
