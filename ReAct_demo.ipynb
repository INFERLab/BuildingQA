    "# Knowledge Graph Question Answering for Building Knowledge Graphs using a ReAct Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements an agentic workflow based on the **ReAct (Reasoning and Acting)** framework to translate natural language questions into precise SPARQL queries. The core of this notebook is a multi-turn refinement process where two specialized agents collaborate to produce, critique, and improve a SPARQL query until it is deemed correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🤖 Methodology: The Two-Agent Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "The agentic workflow is orchestrated by the `SparqlRefinementAgent` class and consists of an iterative loop between two Large Language Model (LLM) powered agents:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Query Writer Agent**:\n",
    "    * **Role**: To generate and revise SPARQL queries.\n",
    "    * **Action**: Given a natural language question and a subset (defined by `num_triples` of the graph) of the graph, it writes an initial SPARQL query. In subsequent turns, it revises the query based on feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Critique Agent**:\n",
    "    * **Role**: To evaluate the query's correctness.\n",
    "    * **Action**: After the Writer's query is executed, the Critique agent reviews the original question, the query itself, and a summary of the execution results. It then makes a decision:\n",
    "        * `FINAL`: The query is correct and successfully answers the question. The loop terminates.\n",
    "        * `IMPROVE`: The query is incorrect, incomplete, or inefficient. The agent provides specific, actionable feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "This feedback is then passed back to the Query Writer Agent, which begins the next iteration by generating an improved query. This cycle continues until a `FINAL` decision is reached or the maximum number of iterations is exceeded.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚙️ Execution Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook follows a systematic process for each building and question:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Configuration**: Configure your API keys and URL for LLM calls.\n",
    "2.  **Define Helper Functions**: Helper functions for logging data and extracting a subset of the graph is defined.\n",
    "3.  **Initialize Agents**: The `SparqlRefinementAgent` is instantiated.\n",
    "4.  **Define a helper function for testing a single question**: `run_single_question` function is defined for initial testing.\n",
    "5.  **Configure the necessary test conditions**: Key parameters such as the target building (`BUILDING_NAME`), LLM (`MODEL_NAME`), and SPARQL endpoint are set.\n",
    "4.  **Process All Questions and Buildings**: The script iterates through each question in the JSON file.\n",
    "    * The **ReAct loop** is triggered for the current question.\n",
    "    * The final query generated by the agent is executed.\n",
    "    * The ground-truth query is executed for comparison.\n",
    "    * Key metrics are computed and saved. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📊 Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "To rigorously assess the correctness of the generated SPARQL query, the following metrics are calculated and logged:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Arity Matching F1**: Checks if the query returned the correct **number of columns**.\n",
    "* **Exact Match F1**: A strict check for identical row content and column **order**, though it ignores column names.\n",
    "* **Entity Set F1**: Flexibly checks if the correct **sets of values** were retrieved in each column, regardless of row structure or column order.\n",
    "* **Row Matching F1**: The most robust metric. It finds the optimal column alignment and then checks for an exact, row-for-row match of the content. This is the primary indicator of a perfectly correct query."

      "   -> Critique Feedback: The SPARQL query correctly retrieves nodes that have an external reference by checking for the predicate ref:hasExternalReference. It uses a direct triple pattern which matches the original question asking for nodes with information about an external reference. The query's use of DISTINCT and the provided prefixes aligns with the Brick Schema conventions. The published results showing nodes with a blank node for external references confirm that the query is functioning as expected. Thus, no improvements are necessary.\n",
